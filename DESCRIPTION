Description: This library contains functions for simulating and testing models of Bilingual-Led Divergence, such as described in the paper: Ellison, TM & L Miceli (forthcoming) Language Monitoring in Bilinguals as a Mechanism for Rapid Lexical Divergence. Language. The (R6) classes include TensorModel implementing the cognitive models in the paper, PopulationSimulation proving agent-based simulations where each agent implements the cognitive model, and L2017 which constructs the graphs and statistics presented in the paper.
